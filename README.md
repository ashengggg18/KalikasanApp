<h2>📌 Project Description</h2>
<p>
  <strong>Project KALIKASAN: Tracing Plastic Waste Reduction is a Java-based program that tracks and records each user’s plastic waste reduction activities. The system allows users to input data about their daily plastic usage and recycling habits. Using Java’s data handling and file management features, it securely stores and updates each user’s progress. It also generates reports showing how much plastic waste each user has reduced over time. Through this project, Java technology is used to promote environmental responsibility and encourage sustainable living practices..

<h2>🧩 OOP Concepts Applied</h2>
<p>
  This project incorporates several Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to make the system 
  organized, efficient, and maintainable:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Encapsulation</strong> – Sensitive user data is hidden inside classes and accessed only through 
    getters and setters, protecting it from accidental modifications.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Inheritance</strong> – Reusable class structures minimize code duplication and make future 
    updates easier to implement.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Polymorphism</strong> – Methods behave differently depending on the object that calls them, 
    increasing flexibility when handling various types of data.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Abstraction</strong> – Complex processes are simplified by breaking them into smaller, 
    manageable methods.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  These OOP principles make the project cleaner, scalable, and easier to understand.

<h2>🛠️ Program Structure</h2>
<p>
  The system is built around several key classes, each with a specific role:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>User</strong> – Stores user information such as name, daily plastic waste data, and progress.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>PlasticTracker</strong> – Handles calculations and updates related to plastic waste reduction.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>FileHandler</strong> – Responsible for reading and writing user data to ensure secure and 
    accurate storage.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>ReportGenerator</strong> – Compiles user data and generates readable progress reports.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Each class has a clear purpose, minimizing confusion and making the system easier to maintain or upgrade. 
  The organized, text-based hierarchy ensures smooth program flow and supports future improvements.
